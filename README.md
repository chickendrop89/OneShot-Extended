# Overview
**OneShot-Extended** performs the [Pixie Dust attack](https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?24286-WPS-Pixie-Dust-Attack-Offline-WPS-Attack) without the requirement of monitor mode.

This is an improved version of the original OneShot

## Advantages over original OneShot
 - Highlighting of a vulnerable WPS version (1.0) in the scanner
 - Ability to save the AP right into the Network Manager of your system
 - Ability to clear the screen every scan
 - Minor changes (e.g, WPA3TM indication, better vulnwsc detection, RF-Kill handling)
 - Works on modern python versions (>3.9)
 - Improved Android support

# Features
 - [Pixie Dust attack](https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?24286-WPS-Pixie-Dust-Attack-Offline-WPS-Attack)
 - Null Pin attack
 - Offline WPS PIN generating algorithm
 - [Online WPS bruteforce](https://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf)
 - Wi-Fi scanner with highlighting based on iw;
 - Ability to write to a file

  -p, --pin PIN                : Use the specified pin (arbitrary string or 4/8 digit pin). Enter a blank pin (e.g. '') for a Null Pin attack
  -K, --pixie-dust             : Run Pixie Dust attack
  -F, --pixie-force            : Run Pixiewps with --force option (bruteforce full range)
  -B, --bruteforce             : Run online bruteforce attack

Advanced arguments:
  -d, --delay <n>              : Set the delay between pin attempts
  --vuln-list VULN_LIST        : Use custom file with vulnerable devices list

  -X, --show-pixie-cmd         : Always print Pixiewps command
  -w, --write                  : Write credentials to the file on success
  -s, --save                   : Save the AP to network manager on success
  -l, --loop                   : Run in a loop
  -c, --clear                  : Clear the screen on every wi-fi scan
  -r, --reverse-scan           : Reverse order of networks in the list of networks. Useful on small displays
  --mtk-wifi                   : Activate MediaTek Wi-Fi interface driver on startup and deactivate it on exit (for internal Wi-Fi adapters implemented in MediaTek SoCs). 
                               : Turn off Wi-Fi in the system settings before using this.
  --dts, --dont-touch-settings : Don't touch the Android Wi-Fi settings on startup and exit.
                               : Use when having device-specific issues
  --iface-down                 : Down network interface when the work is finished
  -v, --verbose                : Verbose output
  -h, --help                   : show this help message and exit
 ```

# Installation

## Termux
**Please note that root access is required.**  

**Installing requirements**
 ```shell
 pkg install -y root-repo
 pkg install -y git tsu python wpa-supplicant pixiewps iw openssl
 ```
**Getting OneShot-Extended**
 ```shell
 cd ~
 git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/chickendrop89/OneShot-Extended ose
 ```
**Running**
 ```shell
 sudo python ose/ose.py -i wlan0
 ```

## Linux distributions 
**Install these packages through your distro's package manager:**
 ```shell
 python3 wpa-supplicant iw wget pixiewps
 ```
 
**Getting OneShot**
 ```shell
 cd ~
 git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/chickendrop89/OneShot-Extended ose
 ```
**Running**
 ```shell
 sudo python ose/ose.py -i wlan0
 ```

# Update procedure
1. Change directory to where OneShot-Extended is cloned
```
cd OneShot-Extended
```

2. Update via git to latest commit, this will revert any local changes
```
git fetch
git reset --hard origin/master
```

# Troubleshooting

### `Device or resource busy (-16)`
This happens because something else is trying to use the interface (Wi-Fi scanner/Network managers)

- Android: try re-running the tool few times
- Linux: try disabling Wi-Fi in the system settings, and kill the Network manager.
- Alternatively: you can try running OneShot-Extended with ```--iface-down``` argument.

### The wlan0 interface disappears when Wi-Fi is disabled on Android devices with MediaTek SoC
- Try running Oneshot-Extended with the `--mtk-wifi` flag to initialize Wi-Fi device driver.
